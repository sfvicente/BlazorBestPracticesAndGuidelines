# Security | CPU Exhaustion

CPU exhaustion is a computing state in which CPU performance has been partially or completely degraded. This performance related to the ability of the CPU carry out
legimate requests and instructions. In Blazor Server apps, CPU exhaustion can occur when one or more clients force or induce the server to perform task or operations
that result in intensive CPU work.
