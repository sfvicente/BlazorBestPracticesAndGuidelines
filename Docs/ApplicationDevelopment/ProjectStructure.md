## Static Assets

Static assets are resources sent to the browser that do not change in the server. One example of static assets are images used on web applications.
<br>


### Always place static assets under the project's web root (wwwroot) folder.

The web root is the base path for public and static resource files of a web application. Web servers are normally configured serve static assets only from the web root
folder and its sub-folders. 

Blazor applications, just like ASP.NET Core apps, place static assets inside the project's web root folder.
