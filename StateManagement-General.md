**Use custom code to persist UI state.**

User interface state can't be persisted in a similar way to component instances and their render trees. To persist something similar to UI state, such as the expanded nodes of a TreeView, the app must have custom code to model the behavior as serializable app state.

```csharp
TODO: Example
```
