# Security

**Always use HTTPS  to protect information in transit** 
[Blazor Server]

SignalR is the mechanism used for communication between a client and the server. A Blazor Server application normally uses the transport that SignalR negotiates, which is typically WebSockets.
A Blazor Server application doesn't ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data sent between the server and the client, so HTTPS is required.
